## 🚀 Features

Food Tracker has three main features:

1. **Keep track of food items:** You can add items to your virtual pantry by selecting from a list of 1000 cached items 📝, entering an expiry date ⌛, attaching a label 🏷️, and specifying the quantity type and amount 📈. You can also take or upload a photo 📷 to help you remember where the item is stored. The app stores all your items securely and efficiently using Android Room, and allows you to search and filter your items by name or label. You'll also get notifications 📲 when an item is about to expire, or nudge you if you're out of stock.

2. **Find nearby foodbanks:** With Food Tracker, you can have Google Maps 🗺️ launched to find nearby foodbanks and charities that accept donations. The app uses your geolocation 📍 to suggest the closest options, so you can easily drop off any surplus food you may have.

3. **Discover recipes:** Food Tracker also lets you discover new recipes 🌯 based on the ingredients you have in your pantry. The app queries the Spoonacular API to recommend recipes that use your items, and provides a list of recipes with details and instructions. You can then choose recipes that conform to your dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free 🌾 or vegan 🌿.
